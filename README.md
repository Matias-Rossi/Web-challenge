# Web-challenge

I initially wanted to do a challenge involving building various websites in a short span of time, but I've decided to learn new technologies along the way (like React) so I scrapped that Idea. The only react site here is "Restaurante", which is based on a restaurant I really like. It's my first react and design project. The design is based on [this website](https://www.borealcoffee.ch/). [My site can be seen here](https://main--extrawurst.netlify.app/). 

I know there is a lot I am yet to learn, but everyone starts somewhere!

The site products don't show as the backend isn't deployed anywhere.
