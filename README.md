# Web-challenge

I initially wanted to do a challenge involving building various websites in a short span of time, but I've decided to learn new technologies along the way (like React) so I scrapped that Idea. The only react site here is "Restaurante", which is based on a restaurant I really like. It's my first react and design project. The design is based on [this website](https://www.borealcoffee.ch/). [My site can be seen here](https://main--extrawurst.netlify.app/) (Press X on the popup warning).

Known issues:

 - There is an issue with containers having too much left margin
 - There is no responsiveness at all
 - The site products don't show as the backend isn't deployed anywhere
 - Logging in is not implemented
 
I know how to solve this issues, but I haven't had the time to fix them *yet*.

I'm aware there is a lot I have yet to learn, but everyone starts somewhere!
